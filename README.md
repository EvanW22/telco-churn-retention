# Telecom Customer Churn and Retention

### Section 1 - Project Summary
Built a customer churn prediction model for a telecommunications dataset and created a retention simulation to maximize profit. The final model achieved a PR-AUC of 0.673 (26.5% churn rate) and generated an estimated $28.7k in expected retention profit from 506 targeted customers.

### Section 2 - Data and Problem Statement
Given a dataset representing customer subscription and billing data from a telecom provider, predict customer churn. Then, identify high-risk customers and deploy a retention strategy to optimize retention spending and future customer value.
